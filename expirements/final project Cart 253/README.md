Artist's Statement

For this JavaScript maze game, my goal was to build an immersive journey that embodied the love of a crab parent trying to find their lost child. In my game, I wanted puzzle-solving paired with a funny narrative. From an artistic perspective, I wanted to bring in a combination of vibrant colours and funny cartoon graphics. Overall, my goal was to offer a game that is both challenging and captivating enough to strive to achieve the Good Ending.

Taking inspiration from Club Penguin's incredible minigames, the goal of my JavaScript maze game is to recreate that feeling of a simple, childish game. A small nod to this would be the Main character himself being a “pet” in the original club penguin games.
